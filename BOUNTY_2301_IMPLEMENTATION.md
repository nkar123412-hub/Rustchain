# Bounty Issue #2301 Implementation Report

**Issue:** Interactive RustChain Mining Simulator — try before you mine  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Branch:** `feat/issue2301-interactive-mining-simulator`  
**Commit:** `19df311`  
**Date:** March 22, 2026  
**Bounty Value:** 40 RTC (base) + 10 RTC (bonus) = **50 RTC**

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a browser-based interactive simulator that demonstrates RustChain's Proof of Antiquity mining mechanism. The simulator allows users to experience the complete mining loop—hardware detection, attestation submission, epoch participation, and reward calculation—before committing real hardware.

**All acceptance criteria met. All bonus features implemented.**
