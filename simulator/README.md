## Mining Loop Simulation

### Stage 1: Hardware Detection 🔍

Demonstrates RustChain's hardware fingerprinting system:
- **CPU Architecture** - Detects processor type (PowerPC, x86, etc.)
- **Antiquity Score** - Calculates hardware age multiplier
- **Hardware Serial** - Generates unique hardware identifier
- **TPM Attestation** - Verifies trusted platform module
- **Memory Profile** - Scans RAM configuration
- **Disk Signature** - Reads storage device signature

**Animation:** Each fingerprint component scans sequentially with visual feedback (scanning → verified states).

### Stage 2: Attestation Submission 📜

Shows the attestation payload format submitted to the network:

```json
{
    "miner_id": "0x...",
    "hardware_type": "PowerBook G4",
    "multiplier": 2.5,
    "fingerprint": "0x...",
    "timestamp": 1234567890,
    "signature": "0x...",
    "attestation_proof": "0x..."
}
```

**Educational Note:** Explains how the network validates hardware proofs.

### Stage 3: Epoch Participation ⏱️

Simulates the round-robin miner selection process:
- **10-minute epoch timer** (accelerated for demo)
- **6 slot visualization** showing miner rotation
- **Weighted selection** based on antiquity multiplier
- **Real-time status updates** (Waiting → Selected → Mining)

**Key Concept:** Higher multiplier = higher probability of selection.

### Stage 4: Reward Calculation 💰

Displays estimated rewards across multiple timeframes:
- Per Epoch (10 min)
- Per Hour
- Per Day
- Per Week
- Per Month
- Per Year

**Calculation Formula:**
```
userShare = userMultiplier / totalNetworkWeight
reward = userShare × RTC_PER_EPOCH × epochs
```
