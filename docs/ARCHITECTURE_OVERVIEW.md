## 1. Protocol Overview

RustChain is a **Proof-of-Antiquity** blockchain that rewards real vintage hardware with higher mining multipliers than modern machines. The network uses **6+ hardware fingerprint checks** to prevent VMs and emulators from earning rewards. There are currently 9 active miners and 3 attestation nodes. The native token is **RTC (RustChain Token)**.

### Key Properties
- **Total Supply:** 8.3M RTC
- **Consensus:** RIP-200 (Proof of Antiquity)
- **Block Time:** ~60 seconds
- **Epoch Duration:** ~24 hours
- **Native Token:** RTC
- **Anchor Chain:** Ergo (for cross-chain bridge)
- **Reference Rate:** 1 RTC = $0.15 USD

### Live Network
- **Node Health:** `curl -sk https://50.28.86.131/health`
- **Active Miners:** `curl -sk https://50.28.86.131/api/miners`
- **Block Explorer:** `https://50.28.86.131/explorer`

## 2. RIP-200: Proof of Antiquity Consensus

RIP-200 (RustChain Improvement Proposal 200) defines the Proof of Antiquity consensus mechanism. Unlike Proof of Work (computational waste) or Proof of Stake (capital-weighted), Proof of Antiquity rewards **real vintage hardware** based on verifiable age and authenticity.

### Core Principles
1. **Age-Based Multipliers:** Older hardware earns higher rewards per epoch
2. **Anti-Emulation:** 6+ fingerprint checks prevent VM/fake submissions
3. **Attestation-Gated:** Only attested miners receive settlement rewards
4. **Fair Distribution:** No pre-mine, no VC allocation

### Consensus Flow
1. Miners perform work cycles and collect hardware telemetry
2. Miners submit **attestation payloads** to attestation nodes
3. Attestation nodes verify hardware fingerprints (CPU, GPU, OS, etc.)
4. Verified attestation receipts are included in blocks
5. At epoch boundary, rewards are calculated and distributed based on antiquity multipliers

### Component Roles

| Component | Role | Quantity |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Vintage Miner** | Performs mining work, submits attestation payloads | 9 active |
| **Attestation Node** | Verifies hardware fingerprints, issues receipts | 3 active |
| **Block Producer** | Creates blocks from verified attestations | Network |
| **Epoch Settlement** | Calculates and distributes rewards every ~24h | Protocol |
| **Ergo Bridge** | Cross-chain anchoring for wRTC on Solana | External |

## 4. Network Architecture & P2P Protocol

### Network Topology

RustChain uses a peer-to-peer network where miners connect to attestation nodes, and attestation nodes communicate with each other for consensus.

### P2P Protocol

Miners communicate with attestation nodes via HTTP/HTTPS REST API. The protocol supports:

- **Attestation Submission:** POST `/attest/submit` with signed hardware telemetry
- **Status Queries:** GET endpoints for epoch, miner status, network health
- **WebSocket Feed:** Real-time block and epoch event streaming

### Node Discovery
- Boot nodes are configured at startup
- Peer lists are exchanged via `/api/peers` endpoint
- Connection persistence with keepalive

### Message Types
1. **Attestation Payload:** Miner → Node (hardware telemetry + signature)
2. **Attestation Receipt:** Node → Miner (verified result)
3. **Block Announcement:** Node → Peers (new block notification)
4. **Epoch Settlement:** Network-wide (reward calculation event)

---

## 5. Attestation Flow

The attestation process is the core mechanism that validates real hardware and prevents emulation.

### Attestation Flow Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Miner as Vintage Miner
    participant Node as Attestation Node
    participant Fingerprint as Fingerprint Engine
    participant Ledger as Epoch Ledger

    Miner->>Node: POST /attest/submit (telemetry payload)
    Note over Node: Receive signed attestation
    Node->>Fingerprint: Verify hardware fingerprints
    Fingerprint->>Fingerprint: CPU architecture check
    Fingerprint->>Fingerprint: Clock drift analysis
    Fingerprint->>Fingerprint: Instruction timing
    Fingerprint->>Fingerprint: Memory latency patterns
    Fingerprint->>Fingerprint: OS artifact detection
    Fingerprint->>Fingerprint: GPU signature (if applicable)
    Fingerprint-->>Node: Pass/Fail result + antiquity score
    alt Verified
        Node->>Ledger: Record attestation receipt
        Node-->>Miner: 200 OK + receipt + epoch position
    else Rejected
        Node-->>Miner: 400/403 + rejection reason
    end
```

### Attestation Payload Structure

```json
{
  "miner_id": "miner-pubkey-ed25519",
  "epoch": 1234,
  "hardware": {
    "cpu_arch": "ppc",
    "cpu_model": "PowerPC G4 7447A",
    "os": "Linux",
    "fingerprint_hash": "sha256-hash-of-hw-telemetry"
  },
  "work": {
    "cycles_completed": 50000,
    "timestamp_start": 1716800000,
    "timestamp_end": 1716803600
  },
  "signature": "ed25519-signature-of-payload"
}
```

### Rejection Reasons
- **Clock drift too high** — suggests VM/emulator
- **Instruction timing inconsistent** — not matching claimed CPU
- **Memory latency pattern unknown** — unrecognized hardware profile
- **OS artifacts missing** — required system files not present
- **Signature invalid** — tampered or replayed payload

---

## 6. Hardware Fingerprinting

### The 6+1 Fingerprint Checks

RustChain uses a multi-layered fingerprinting system to verify that mining hardware is genuine vintage equipment, not a VM or emulator.

### Fingerprint Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Miner Submits Telemetry] --> B{CPU Architecture Check}
    B -->|Known Vintage| C[Clock Drift Analysis]
    B -->|Unknown| REJECT[Reject: Unknown Architecture]
    C -->|Within Tolerance| D[Instruction Timing]
    C -->|Too Stable| REJECT
    D -->|Matches Profile| E[Memory Latency Patterns]
    D -->|Mismatch| REJECT
    E -->|Recognized Pattern| F[OS Artifact Detection]
    E -->|Uniform/Synthetic| REJECT
    F -->|All Artifacts Present| G[GPU Signature Check]
    F -->|Missing| REJECT
    G -->|Verified Vintage GPU| H[Antiquity Score Calculated]
    G -->|Modern/Unknown| H
    H --> I[Attestation Receipt Issued]

    classDef reject fill:#f88,color:#fff
    class REJECT reject
```

### Check Details

| # | Check | What It Detects | Vintage Indicator |
|---|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **CPU Architecture** | Claims of unsupported arch | PowerPC, SPARC, 68K, PA-RISC |
| 2 | **Clock Drift** | Perfect clock = VM | Real hardware has micro-drift |
| 3 | **Instruction Timing** | Emulator timing patterns | Vintage CPU has unique timing profile |
| 4 | **Memory Latency** | Synthetic memory patterns | Real RAM has variable latency |
| 5 | **OS Artifacts** | Missing system indicators | Vintage OS leaves specific traces |
| 6 | **GPU Signature** | Modern GPU on old system | Vintage GPU has unique identifiers |
| +1 | **Composite Score** | Combined analysis | Overall antiquity confidence |

## 7. Epoch Settlement & Rewards

### Epoch Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Epoch Start<br/>Block Height N] --> B[Miners Submit<br/>Attestations]
    B --> C[Attestation Nodes<br/>Verify & Record]
    C --> D[Epoch End<br/>~24 Hours Later]
    D --> E[Reward Calculation<br/>Antiquity Multipliers]
    E --> F[Reward Distribution<br/>RTC to Miners]
    F --> A

    style A fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
    style D fill:#FF9800,color:#fff
    style F fill:#2196F3,color:#fff
```

### Settlement Process
1. **Epoch begins** at a defined block height
2. **Miners submit** attestation payloads throughout the epoch
3. **Attestation nodes verify** each submission against fingerprint criteria
4. **Verified receipts** are recorded in the epoch ledger
5. **At epoch end**, the protocol calculates rewards:
   - Base reward per work cycle
   - Antiquity multiplier based on verified hardware age
   - Deductions for failed attestations
6. **Rewards distributed** to miner wallets automatically

### Antiquity Multipliers

| Hardware Era | Example | Approximate Multiplier |
|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| **1980s** | 68020, SPARCstation 1 | 10x - 20x |
| **1990s** | PowerPC 604, Pentium | 5x - 10x |
| **2000s** | PowerPC G4, Athlon | 2x - 5x |
| **2010s** | x86_64 server | 1x - 2x |
| **Modern** | Latest CPU/GPU | 0.5x - 1x |

## 8. Token Economics

### RTC Token

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | RustChain Token |
| **Symbol** | RTC |
| **Total Supply** | 8.3M |
| **Distribution** | Mining rewards (100%) |
| **Reference Rate** | 1 RTC = $0.15 USD |

### Distribution Model
- **100% to miners** — no pre-mine, no team allocation, no VC
- **Antiquity-weighted** — vintage hardware earns proportionally more
- **Epoch-based** — rewards distributed every ~24 hours
- **Declining emission** — total supply capped at 8.3M

### Cross-Chain Bridge (wRTC)
- **Bridge Type:** RustChain ↔ Solana via Ergo anchor
- **Wrapped Token:** wRTC on Solana
- **Lock Mechanism:** RTC locked on RustChain → wRTC minted on Solana

## 9. Vintage Mining

### Why Vintage Hardware?

Vintage mining is the core innovation of RustChain. By rewarding old hardware more than new, the protocol:

1. **Reduces energy waste** — no incentive for hash rate races
2. **Preserves computing history** — gives old machines economic purpose
3. **Democratizes mining** — cheap/old hardware is competitive
4. **Prevents centralization** — modern data centers have no advantage

### Getting Started
1. Find vintage hardware (eBay, surplus stores, donations)
2. Install RustChain miner software
3. Configure wallet address
4. Connect to attestation node
5. Submit attestations and earn RTC

### Supported Miner Configurations
- **Native:** Run directly on vintage hardware
- **Cross-compiled:** Build on modern machine, deploy to vintage target
- **Remote attestation:** Hardware telemetry collected remotely

## 10. Comparison with Proof-of-Stake

| Aspect | Proof-of-Stake (Ethereum) | Proof-of-Antiquity (RustChain) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Resource** | Capital (staked ETH) | Vintage hardware |
| **Energy** | Low | Low |
| **Centralization Risk** | High (whale dominance) | Low (hardware diversity) |
| **Barrier to Entry** | High ($$$ to stake) | Low (cheap vintage HW) |
| **Security Model** | Economic finality | Hardware attestation + consensus |
| **Reward Distribution** | Proportional to stake | Proportional to antiquity |
| **Environmental Impact** | Low | Very low (reuses old HW) |
